            <h3>What is Discord Ball Z ?</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Discord Ball Z</b> is a <b>free text based RPG</b> developed for the <a href="https://discordapp.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> platform
                inspired by the <b>Dragon Ball Universe</b>.<br>
                <br>
                In this game you will be able to <b>collect Dragon Ball</b> characters, <b>train</b> them, <b>build</b> a team of your favorite characters
                and lead them to combat against powerful foes !<br>
                <br>
                Each character is <b>unique</b>, meaning that each character has its own <b>passive skills</b> (such as <i>leader</i> and <i>passive</i>)
                and set of <b>abilities</b>.
            </p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <h4>Note</h4>
                <p>
                    Please note that the game has been <b>inspired</b> by the mobile game 
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandainamcogames.dbzdokkanww" target="_blank">Dokkan Battle</a> but it is not a copy of it,
                    meaning that you might not find all the characters you know from this game in <b>Discord Ball Z</b>.<br>
                    <br>
                    We did something new and different.

            <h3>What is my goal as a player ?</h3>
            <p>
                There is no goal defined, <b>you decide</b> of what you want to accomplish in the game.<br>
                <br>
                Here is a list of <b>non-exhaustive</b> goals you might decide to have :<br>
                <br>
                • Collect all the characters in the game.<br>
                • Being the richest tradesman in the game (<i>Buying reselling</i>, item farming, etc.)<br>
                • Having the strongest team in the game and grind as much <b>Muscle Tower</b> floors as possible.<br>
                • Being at the top of the <b>ladders</b> each season.<br>
                <br>
                And much more ...<br>
                To be honest, there is no real goal, you are the only one who can decide what to do in the game, and there is a lot to do ! 
            </p>
